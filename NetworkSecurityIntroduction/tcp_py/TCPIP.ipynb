This is the simplest form of a TCP client, but the one you will write most \\noften.\\nIn the above code snippet, we are making some serious assumptions \\nabout sockets that you de˜nitely want to be aware of. The ˜rst assump\\n-tion is that our connection will always succeed, and the second is that the \\n\\nserver is always expecting us to send data ˜rst (as opposed to servers that \\n\\nexpect to send data to you ˜rst and await your response). Our third assump\\n-tion is that the server will always send us data back in a timely fashion. We \\n\\nmake these assumptions largely for simplicity™s sake. While programmers \\n\\nhave varied opinions about how to deal with blocking sockets, exception-\\n\\nhandling in sockets, and the like, it™s quite rare for pentesters to build these \\n\\nniceties into the quick-and-dirty tools for recon or exploitation work, so \\n\\nwe™ll omit them in this chapter.  \\nUDP \\nClient\\nA Python UDP client is not much different than a TCP client; we need to \\n\\nmake only two small changes to get it to send packets in UDP form. \\nimport sockettarget_host = \"127.0.0.1\"target_port = 80# create a socket object client = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)# send some data client.sendto(\"AAABBBCCC\",(target_host,target_port))# receive some data data, addr = client.recvfrom(4096) print dataAs you can see, we change the socket type to \\nSOCK_DGRAM  when creat\\n-ing the socket object. The next step is to simply call \\nsendto() , passing in \\nthe data and the server you want to send the data to. Because UDP is a con\\n-nectionless protocol, there is no call to \\nconnect() beforehand. The last step \\nis to call \\nrecvfrom()  to receive UDP data back. You will also notice that it \\nreturns both the data and the details of the remote host and port.\\nAgain, we™re not looking to be superior network programmers; we want \\nto be quick, easy, and reliable enough to handle our day-to-day hacking \\ntasks.
