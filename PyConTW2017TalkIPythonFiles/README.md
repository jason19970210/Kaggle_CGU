This is the data of a Talk given for PyCon TW - 2017. Materials were formed by  three IPython notebook files:

1. [Part1: Data Cleaning](Dengue-taiwan-2016.ipynb)<br>
2. [Part2: Attack Coefficient $R_t$](Rt_pyton.ipynb)<br>
3. [Part3: Stochastic Prediction Models](EpidemicpredictModel.ipynb)<br>

almost anything there except the data from Tainan city government. You can try to bake one as exercise follows **Part1**, ;-). Welcome any question or comment.
